# change-my-view-2025

This work is the final project in Text Mining curse at the Jerusalem College of Technology, 2025.

Change My View (CMV) is a popular subreddit on Reddit where users engage in structured debates with the goal of persuading 
others to reconsider their viewpoints. Unlike typical internet arguments, CMV encourages respectful discourse, requiring 
users to provide well-reasoned arguments and evidence. A core feature of CMV is the "delta" system: if a user successfully 
changes another participant’s mind, the persuaded user awards them a "delta" symbol (∆). This delta serves as an indicator 
of a convincing argument, making CMV a unique platform for studying persuasion in online discussions. The structured format 
of the forum, combined with the delta-based feedback, provides a valuable dataset for analyzing what makes an argument compelling.

Previous research has leveraged CMV discussions to study persuasion, but earlier studies were often limited by the analytical
methods available at the time. With recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, we now 
have the tools to extract more nuanced insights from text data. By applying modern text mining techniques, such as 
transformer-based language models and sophisticated feature engineering methods, we can potentially improve upon previous 
results and enhance our understanding of what makes an argument compelling. This work has practical applications in areas 
such as automated debate analysis, content moderation, and persuasive writing assistance.
