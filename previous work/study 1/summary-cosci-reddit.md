The paper, "Attitude Change on Reddit's Change My View," explores how individuals on the Reddit forum **Change My View (CMV)** adjust their beliefs on various topics, particularly focusing on sociomoral issues (e.g., politics, morality) compared to non-sociomoral topics (e.g., humor, fiction). Here are the key points:

1. **Background and Motivation**: People often resist evidence that contradicts their beliefs, especially regarding deeply rooted moral and social topics. Understanding how attitudes can change in naturalistic environments is crucial for societal progress.

2. **Research Objectives**:
   - Examine if sociomoral topics lead to less frequent attitude change compared to non-sociomoral topics.
   - Analyze the role of evidence, such as citations and statistical language, in promoting attitude change.

3. **Methods**:
   - Data was collected from 500 highly discussed CMV posts using the Reddit API.
   - Posts were classified as sociomoral or non-sociomoral.
   - Attitude change was measured through awarded "deltas" (indicating a shift in belief).
   - Evidence use was quantified by the presence of external links and statistical language in comments.

4. **Findings**:
   - Sociomoral topics generate more interest and evidence-based discussions than non-sociomoral topics.
   - Despite the increased use of evidence, attitude change rates were similar across both categories.
   - Evidence (links, data, statistics) positively predicted attitude change, though overall belief shifts were rare.

5. **Implications**:
   - While changing deeply held beliefs is challenging, providing factual evidence can influence attitudes, even in sociomoral debates.
   - CMV users are likely more open to evidence-based arguments than the general population, but the findings still align with broader trends of resistance to attitude change.

6. **Limitations and Future Directions**:
   - CMV users may not represent the general population due to their willingness to engage in debates.
   - Attitude change might occur without explicit acknowledgment (e.g., awarding deltas).
   - Further research is needed to generalize these findings to less motivated populations.

In summary, the study highlights the difficulty of altering sociomoral beliefs but suggests that evidence-based arguments can be effective in fostering attitude change under certain conditions.
